## What It Does

Anatomist tracks your body through your webcam and displays interactive 3D anatomical models that move with you in real-time. The application can detect your entire body, including your pose, hands, and face, then overlays detailed anatomical models like muscle structures directly onto your body.

## Features

### Real-time Body Tracking
- Detects your full body pose, including arms, legs, torso, and head
- Tracks detailed hand movements and finger positions
- Recognizes facial features and expressions
- Visualizes your skeleton with color-coded overlays

### 3D Anatomical Models
- **Arm Musculature**: See detailed 3D models of arm muscles that follow your arm movements
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Models automatically position, rotate, and scale to match your body
- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch anatomical structures move in real-time as you move

### Live Feedback
- See which body parts are currently detected
- Real-time visualization of your pose and movements
- Clear indicators when body parts are recognized

## Getting Started

1. **Open the application** in your web browser
2. **Click "Start Detection with 3D Model"** to begin
3. **Allow camera access** when prompted
4. **Position yourself** 3-6 feet from your camera with your full body visible
5. **Move your arms** to see the 3D anatomical model overlay appear
